## Description
In this project, you will be creating a drag and drop system that allows users to place markers on a coordinate grid.
Markers should snap to the closest X and Y cordinate.

## Requirements
Create a webpage that has a main content area with a left sidebar.
In the sidebar, create a list of 4 markers.
Each marker displays the X and Y coordinate they should be placed on.
In the main content area, use the D3 library to create a 10x10 grid.
Below the grid, create a "check" button that is disabled until all items are dragged onto the grid.
After the user clicks the "check" button, display correct or incorrect on the screen.
